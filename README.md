### What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
In HTML, you are free to do whatever you want as you don’t have to return a single parent element while in JSX you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile.
HTML is a very important language in web development. Your code is either in HTML originally or compiles to it so browsers can read it.JSX, on the other hand, means JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML  is an extension of JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML right within JavaScript.
In terms of support by browsers, HTML is supported by all of them. JSX, on the other hand, was never really intended to be, so you need a compiler like Babel or Webpack to transpile JSX into the JavaScript that browsers understand.

### Why can’t browsers read JSX?
Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object.
